# Brett

Brett is a Kanban board that understands emails and threads.

You can use it without referring to emails and threads as a normal Kanban board, too, but the email workflow is where it
shines:

A card is a topic. When you import (paste, load, etc) an email, you can choose to start a new card or to add it to an
existing card. Add a one-line summary if you want, and … that's it!
